# Matplotlib Observations
## Observations of the Pymaceuticals data set:
1 - The Capomulin and Ramicane regimens were widely the most effective of all of the drugs used in the study.  Their mean tumor size of 40 was much lower then the 52 to 54 range of the other drugs.
2 - However, Capomulin and Ramicane also represented the most used drug as it was used with 225 mice were the other drugs were less then 190.  In a trial of this nature, efforts should be made to have equal numbers of mice to remove that as a variable.
3 - When viewing how the drug effected a specific mouse over time, it was interesting to note that the tumor continued to grow for the first 20 days before it began to shrink rapidly over the next 10 to 12 days.
